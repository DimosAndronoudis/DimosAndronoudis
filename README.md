# Dimos Andronoudis

Junior AI / Python Developer (Athens) working on agentic AI systems. 
Currently building agentic AI projects while actively producing music (audio + AI is the long-term direction). 🎧

- **Collaboration:** open to projects at the intersection of **audio + AI** (speech, music, audio tooling, agents for audio workflows).

## Featured projects

### Thesis — Speech deepfake detection (One-Class KD + Student-SVM)
**One-Class Teacher–Student Distillation and a Lightweight Student-SVM Pipeline for speech deepfake detection**

One-class teacher–student distillation for audio deepfake detection using an XLS-R 300M teacher trained on ASVspoof2019-LA and a lightweight student (plus student-embedding SVM). Evaluated by EER on ASVspoof2021 DF/LA and In-the-Wild.

**Results (EER):** 3.64% (ASVspoof2021 DF) / 8.88% (ASVspoof2021 LA) / 6.89% (In-the-Wild)  
**Note:** Student+SVM inference is faster but weaker than the full pipeline.
